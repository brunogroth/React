React uses JSX - Javascript Syntax Extension, wich allow us to use JS and HTML Components as return in functions.

Focus in SPA, with react, you can make a pattern as <Header title="My Title"/> for titles or <Description props="props"/> for a description. Increases dynamism.

STATES

Components can have "state" which is an object that determines how it renders and behaves.
Ex: state "open" or "close" for an dropdown.

"App" or "Global" state refers to state available to the entire UI, not just a single interface.

After React 16.8, we can use functional components with hooks.

REACT HOOKS
Hooks are function that let us hook into the React state (open, close) and lifecycle features from function components
    Ex: useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, useRef.
